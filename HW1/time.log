     1/27  5:30 pm     1:30    read background material; set up files; began to
                               brainstorm ideas on how to tackle the multiple
                               parts of the problem; split the assignment into
                               smaller parts that could each be confronted at
                               separate times; consulted with two of my peers
                               about ways to attack the more rigorous parts of
                               this assignment.

                               some of the methods. Here, I began to debug (b/c

                               lack of knowledge for some of the syntax). In other
                               words, I accidentally coded three of the methods in
                               Java syntax and needed to work backwards to debug.
