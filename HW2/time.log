     2/14  11:00pm     1:00    Did diagnostic readings, reviewed C syntax

     2/16  12:10pm     2:05    For some reason, binge-coding worked well here.
                               I got the following done:
                                  - set up for parsing through command arguments
                                  - formatting for final answers
                                  - creation of minIndex and return maximum methods
                                  - sorting algorithm, bubble sort
                                  - least workload heuristic
                                  - bwd + lwd as corollaries

     2/16  3:00pm      1:00    Debugged in the sort algo to make it void
                               Hopefully only backtracking is necessary to implement now.

     2/17  6:30pm      2:00    Began to Draft out backtracking, implemented ps after a discussion
                               with a friend about backtracking and its applications. Will implement
                               heuristics for opt next.

     2/18  11:45am     0:30    Added heuristics A-D.

     2/18  12:00pm     0:30    Fixed parts of heuristics A-D, accounted for Stress Testing.

     2/18  3:30pm      0:55    Finished all heuristics, beginning to work on edge cases.

                       8:00    TOTAL time spent

     I discussed my solution with: Jamie Nachbar, Manahal Tabassum

     The first challenging was being sick, which was entirely out of my control. Then, I had some issues
     understanding what the heuristics were/how to implement them. It took a lot of trial and error. Also,
     backtracking seemed to cause many problems since I had not done/seen backtracking in two years. I was
     not only able to implement it, but also do some reading on other backtracking algorithms like Maze
     Generators (my CPSC201 requirement assignment), NQueens, and Knight's Tour.
