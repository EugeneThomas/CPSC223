     1/27  5:30 pm     1:30    read background material; set up files; began to
                               brainstorm ideas on how to tackle the multiple
                               parts of the problem; split the assignment into
                               smaller parts that could each be confronted at
                               separate times; consulted with two of my peers
                               about ways to attack the more rigorous parts of
                               this assignment.

     1/27  7:30 pm     1:30    After a break, I began to sketch out and write
                               some of the methods. Here, I began to debug (b/c
                               my inexperience in C was really showing in my
                               lack of knowledge for some of the syntax). In other
                               words, I accidentally coded three of the methods in
                               Java syntax and needed to work backwards to debug.

     1/27  10:15 pm    0:15    At this point, I realized that I wasn't going
                               in the right direction in terms of solving this
                               problem, I started over and sketched out how to do
                               the practice example in a more neat way. I'll
                               implement that tomorrow.

     1/30  3:00 pm     1:00    Hour one of an energetic coding series. More to come.

     1/30  4:15 pm     1:00    Hour two of coding, still have to do backward slashes.

     1/30  8:15 pm     1:15    Spent time at office hours deugging and writing out how 
                               to handle line splices. 

     1/30  9:30 pm     0:20    Debugged and finalized the comments of the majority of 
                               the code. The line splicing and escape character handling
                               is what's left.

     I discussed my solution with: Jamie Nachbar, Joyce Wu, Haiyao Liu (Prospective
     CS Major at UMass AMherst and a close friend)
