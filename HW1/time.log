     1/27  5:30 pm     1:30    read background material; set up files; began to
                               brainstorm ideas on how to tackle the multiple
                               parts of the problem; split the assignment into
                               smaller parts that could each be confronted at
                               separate times; consulted with two of my peers
                               about ways to attack the more rigorous parts of
                               this assignment.

     1/27  7:30 pm     1:30    After a break, I began to sketch out and write
                               some of the methods. Here, I began to debug (b/c
                               my inexperience in C was really showing in my
                               lack of knowledge for some of the syntax). In other
                               words, I accidentally coded three of the methods in
                               Java syntax and needed to work backwards to debug.

     1/27  10:15 pm    0:15    At this point, I realized that I wasn't going
                               in the right direction in terms of solving this
                               problem, I started over and sketched out how to do
                               the practice example in a more neat way. I'll
                               implement that tomorrow.

     1/30  3:00 pm     1:00    Hour one of an energetic coding series. More to come.

     1/30  4:15 pm     1:00    Hour two of coding, still have to do backward slashes.

     1/30  8:15 pm     1:15    Spent time at office hours deugging and writing out how 
                               to handle line splices. 

     1/30  9:45 pm     0:30    Debugged and finalized the comments of the majority of 
                               the code. The line splicing and escape character handling
                               is what's left. 

     1/30  10:35 pm    1:00    After another short break, I was able to reach more 
                               conclusions concerning the line splices and escape characters. 
                               Final edits for the night after office hours. 

     1/31  11:45 am    1:00    Was able to pass all 14 test cases as well as comment out all 
                               ideas. Later today, I will discuss how to fight off edge cases
                               that are not listed in the public tests.  

     1/31   1:45 pm    1:00    Since I had a bunch of errands to run, I've been trying out test 
                               cases whenever I had the free time. I've settled a couple and tied
                               up some loose ends in issues with the code that arose. Also, I 
                               commented those sections and began drafting up the challenges.

                       10:00    TOTAL time spent

     I discussed my solution with:  Haiyao Liu (Prospective CS Major at UMass AMherst), 
                                    Rabhya Mehrotra (member of CS223), Jamie Nachbar (member of CS223), 
                                    Manahal Tabassum (member of CS223), Joyce Wu (member of CS223) 

     One of the biggest challenges I faced in this assignment was becoming acquainted with the C language. 
     Usually, my workflow consists of throwing a lot of my ideas out at a rapid-fire rate onto the computer 
     and hoping that a lot of them stick. Of course, when they don't, I go back and see which ideas worked, 
     which ideas needed slight changes, and which failed miserably; my process is a stream of consciousness. 
     When I'm not familiar with the syntax (and what I can and can't do in C) it not only leads to more debugging 
     (I wrote a lot of my initial code in Java by accident), but disrupts my workflow. Also, this is the first 
     computer science assignment (outside of teaching middle schoolers) I have done in over a year, so it suffices
     to say that I was pretty rusty in generating ideas in how to solve problems quickly and succinctly. Finally, 
     because of my lack of knowledge on line splices and valid/invalid examples of C code, it made it very difficult
     to not only attack the problem initially, but to come up with good edge cases as well. Overall, although
     frustrating at times, this assignment allow me to communicate my ideas with others as well as solve a
     pretty large problem by breaking it into smaller pieces. 

     Note: I have no idea why I did this, but while I was submitting the homework incrementally, I was submitting 
     each entry under a different number assignment. For example:

      /../../c/cs223/bin/submit 1 C2html.c Makefile time.log, this is what I typed the first time. 

      /../../c/cs223/bin/submit 2 C2html.c Makefile time.log, this is what I typed the second time. 

      /../../c/cs223/bin/submit n C2html.c Makefile time.log for the nth submission until I reached my 9th submission and got an error. 

     I will definitely clean that up for submissions 2-8, and hopefully this note and the log will suffice as proof for incremental workflow.
