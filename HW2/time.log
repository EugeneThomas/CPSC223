     2/14  11:00pm     1:00    Did diagnostic readings, reviewed C syntax
     2/16  12:10pm     2:05    For some reason, binge-coding worked well here.
                               I got the following done:
                                  - set up for parsing through command arguments
                                  - formatting for final answers
                                  - creation of minIndex and return maximum methods
                                  - sorting algorithm, bubble sort
                                  - least workload heuristic
                                  - bwd + lwd as corollaries
     2/16  3:00pm      1:00    Debugged in the sort algo to make it void
                               Hopefully only backtracking is necessary to implement now.
     2/17  6:30pm      2:00    Began to Draft out backtracking, implemented ps after a discussion
                               with a friend about backtracking and its applications. Will implement
                               heuristics for opt next.
